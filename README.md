## Java

- statically typed. I find it easier to read and modify code if I know the types of things.
- mature ecosystem of libraries and tools
- fast (on the server)
- IntelliJ is a great IDE

## Cassandra NoSQL database

- really fast
- instant strong consistency is possible using "quorum" writes and reads, even if a node is down.
- linear horizontal scaling up to millions of writes/sec
- masterless. no single point of failure
- no wait for failover when a node goes down
- near real time multi-datacenter replication is relatively easy
- SQL-like syntax, tables, columns
